        Important: Only team members explicitly stated on these documents will be considered for the next steps of the DFC, i.e., being eligible to be awarded as winners and joining the author list of the respective potential publications (IGARSS23 and JSTARS articles). Furthermore, no overlap among teams is allowed, i.e., one person can only be a member of one team. Adding more team members after the end of the development phase, i.e., after submitting these documents is not possible.
